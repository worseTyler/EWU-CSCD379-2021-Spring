Please do not share the meeting link with other outside of the class.

## In the meeting

Though not required, when we do encourage everyone to turn on their cameras so we can get to know you.

When not speaking please keep your microphone muted to avoid any outside noise distractions.
If you have questions please feel free to unmute and ask, or simply use the "raise hand" feature.
There is also a chat feature that you are welcome to use to ask questions as well.
